//what is higher order component in React?(State management pattern)

//A higher order component is a function that takes a component as parameter and returns a new component.  When some child component has common state and functionality we can use higher order component that takes a component(the components those are having same state and functionality ) as a parameter and returns a new component. This is so much useful when we are working on an application.We can avoid prop drilling by this pattern.So much helpful from lifting state up pattern in an application.
